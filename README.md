# Aapka Apna HipHop

The next generation Rap tool which uses an ML based approach to generate lyrics for your next rap songs. You can generate lyrics in the style of a specific artist. Currently due to the time constraint, we only support 3 artists, i.e. Eminem, Drake & Kanye West. In the future we expect to increase the number of artists involved in the project.

We have made this project using lyrics of songs of the artists mentioned above. We've used a Tensorflow model that uses LSTM to generate the lyrics word by word, which you can view in Train ipynb files directory. The model is exported to TFJS using the tensorflowjs convertor in python. 

The project comes with a video tutorial which can view [here](https://youtube.com).

The project is deployed for live demo [here](https://aapka-apna-hip-hop.herokuapp.com/).
